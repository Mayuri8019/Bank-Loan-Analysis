# Bank-Loan-Analysis
The project aims to analyse the finance dataset of bank loans for customers through a report , utilizing various software such as Excel , MySQL , Tableau and Power BI.
We employed these tools for analysing , cleaning and removing duplicates from datasets to prepare dashboards and insights , ensuring accurate business decisions are made.

We have two finance-related datasets, "Finance_1" and "Finance_2". The "Finance_1" dataset contains 39,000 rows and 24 columns, while the "Finance_2" dataset has 39,000 rows and 25 columns. Both datasets are in a spreadsheet format, with "Finance_1" being a CSV file and "Finance_2" an XLSX file.
